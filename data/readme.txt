# 1. support(A⇒ B) =P(A ∪ B)

# Support (Books) = Freq (Books)/Total transactions made

# Support (Books) = 6/100 = 0.06%

# 2. Confidence: It is the ratio of combined transactions to individual transactions.

# confidence(A⇒ B) =P(B|A)

# Confidence (Books) = Combined transactions/Individual transaction

# Confidence (Books) = 0.06/0.08 = 0.75

# 3. Lift: It is the ratio of the confidence percent to the support percent.

# Lift = 0.75/0.10 = 7.5

# If the value of lift < 1, the combination is not bought by consumers frequently.
# If the value of lift >1, the combination is brought frequently by the consumers.
# If the value of lift = 1, then the purchase of antecedent makes no difference on the consequent.
